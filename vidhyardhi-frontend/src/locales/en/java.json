It was powerful but still complex, with issues like multiple inheritance and manual memory control.\n- **Java (1990s)** → James Gosling and team wanted a language that kept the power of C/C++ but removed the pitfalls. Java introduced:\n  - Automatic **Garbage Collection** (no manual memory management).\n  - Strict **Object-Oriented Design** (everything is an object; single inheritance + interfaces).\n  - Platform independence via the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** and **bytecode**.\n  - **Security model** with classloader + bytecode verifier.\n  - A rich **standard library** for networking, collections, I/O, and GUIs.",

Though now obsolete, they showcased portability and rich UI on the web.\n- Desktop UI stack: initial **AWT** (native peers, limited widgets) → improved **Swing** (lightweight, pluggable look & feel) enabling richer cross-platform GUIs.\n- Enterprise momentum quickly followed: **Servlets** and **JSP** enabled dynamic server pages, paving the way for **Java EE**.\n- Performance story: the JVM gained **JIT compilation** and later **HotSpot** optimizations, narrowing the gap with native code.\n- Strong standard library from day one (I/O, networking, utilities) made it productive for real-world apps.",

      "desc": "Java's object-oriented nature is defined by three core principles:\n\n1.  **Encapsulation:** The bundling of data (fields) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (a class). It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a way of preventing accidental interference and misuse. This is achieved using **access modifiers** (`private`, `protected`, `public`).\n\n2.  **Inheritance:** This allows a new class (called a **subclass** or **child class**) to inherit the fields and methods of an existing class (called a **superclass** or **parent class**). It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes. Java uses the `extends` keyword for inheritance.\n\n3.  **Polymorphism:** (Meaning 'many forms') It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The most common use is when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. This enables writing flexible and generic code. Polymorphism is often achieved through **method overriding** (runtime polymorphism) and **method overloading** (compile-time polymorphism).",

Problems are broken down into objects that contain both data and behavior. This is ideal for modeling complex, real-world systems (e.g., a banking application with Customer, Account, and Transaction objects).\n\n- **Procedural Paradigm:** The program is structured as a sequence of instructions or procedure calls. In Java, this translates to writing code where the `main` method contains a series of steps and calls to `static` methods, often without creating many objects. This can be suitable for small, simple scripts or mathematical computations.\n\nA well-designed Java program typically uses a blend: the overall architecture is object-oriented, but individual methods may contain procedural logic to get their job done.",

For our example, the file must be named `HelloWorld.java`.\n\n2.  **Compiling the Program:**\n    - Java source code is not directly executed by the computer.

This file contains the bytecode ready for the JVM.\n\n3.  **Running the Program:**\n    - You use the **Java launcher (`java`)** to run the program.
